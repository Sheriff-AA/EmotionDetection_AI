# Emotion Detection AI

A FULL NEURAL NETWORK that can be trained on a dataset of 20,000 images to detect emotion in images. 
Each image is a 96*96 pixel image.

The Python file can be run on the dataset in the code.
If you need access to it, let me know.


UPDATE - Due to how big the dataset is, uploading it was a mess abd caused a bunch of errors
